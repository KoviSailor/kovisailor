# How about a little introduction, ay?!
‚ú® *You can call me __Kovi__ or __Venus__, I'm a really silly individual!*

ü§≠ *I'm a big hololive fan and I really love pranks!! I'm also a jester n'pretty much playful. Usually I'm not really verbal n'tend to just quietly be on my own but you're more off to get me in a good mood if I'm with my [partner](https://github.com/autofister)! Not that I'm always grumpy or anything, I just really love my girlfriend bro... Speaking of which; you should totally interact with her, she's a sweetheart!*

üìå *You're free to interact with me, I like anything!!I don't really have specific interests but I'm really hyper-fixated in Hololive, my special interest is of course my wife... what else would it be?! But in a serious note; feel free to have silly talks with me, I don't bite! Just be mindful of what you say and don't be a jerk.*

# BYI & Silly stuff!! 
üìú *Before you interact... please keep in mind the following!!*
- Very silly n'chill person to be around, doesn't mean I'll sugarcoat stuff or be doing blind eye to wrong stuff though.
- I'm really quiet n'very awkward at first! Although, I'm more comfy interacting if my [Ceci](https://github.com/autofister) is around.
- My social battery drains really fast, so be a little patient with me!
- Mostly cuddling with my [girlfriend](https://github.com/autofister) all the times, come say hi!!
- I do not do roleplay and I absolutely despise it, it's not because I'm cosplaying a certain character that it means I'm acting like them, so please don't.
- I can and will hide you if I feel bothered, be mindful and please watch out of what you're saying.
- **C**+*H* is okay but when I'm with my partner please ask them instead! If she says it's okay, then I won't mind!!
- You're more granted to get a reply if you whisper me!
- You can check more in my pronouns.cc or carrd, it's not a lot!
