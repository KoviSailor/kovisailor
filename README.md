# How about a little introduction, ay?!
✨ *Hey there! You can call me ___Maelis___ or ___Venuste___, whichever tickles your fancy!*

🤭 *I'm a HUGE Hololive fan and I adore playing pranks! Like—mischief is practically my job, right?? I'm a jester through 'n through, always up to something. I’m usually not super talkative tho... I kinda just vibe in my own little corner of the universe unless I'm with my partner... [✨psst, it’s her!✨](https://github.com/autofister) Being around her just makes everything better!! Like—BOOM, instant serotonin!*

📌 *You’re totally free to chat with me ANYTIME! I’m down for anything really!! I don’t have super specific interests, but I’m suuuper hyper-fixated on Hololive... like, duh! And my special special special interest is obviously my wifey!! What else would it even be?! But for real though, feel free to have all the silly talks you want with me! I don’t bite!! Just be cool and not a jerk, then we're gonna be just fine!!*

### BYI & Silly stuff!! 
📜 ***Before you jump into chatting with me... please keep these lil’ things in mind.***
- I’m suuuper silly and chill to hang with, but don’t get it twisted—I won’t sugarcoat stuff or turn a blind eye to bad vibes! Gotta keep it real, innit?
- I’m quiet and awkward at first! But if my [Ceci](https://github.com/autofister) is around, I get wayyyy more comfy and confident!
- My social battery drains faster than you can say “prank time” so please be patient with me!
- 99% of the time I’m just cuddling with my [girlfriend](https://github.com/autofister).
- I do not do roleplay and I really, really despise it! Just because I cosplay a character doesn’t mean I’m acting like them, so please don’t ask me to. Nope nope nope!
- If I feel uncomfortable, I can and WILL hide you—so please be mindful and watch what you say!
- C+H is okay, but if I’m with my partner, you gotta ask her first! If she says it’s cool, then I’m chill with it.
- You’ll probably get a faster reply if you whisper me!
- Wanna know more? Check out my pronouns.cc or carrd! It’s not much, but it’s me.
