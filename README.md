# How about a little introduction, ay?!
✨ *Hey!! I go by the username __Venus__ or __Kovi__, but you can call me whatever you want! As long it's nothing too creepy or I don't know... weird?*

🤭 *I'm a big Hololive fan and tend to really love desserts and pranks... I'm quite the prankster myself!! Although, I'm also a little of a troublemaker sometimes. Just sometimes, worry not! There isn't much to say about me other than just some silly things. I can guarantee you that I'm a very chill and quiet person despite the energy presented in this one biography! Matter of fact, I'm only ever this hyper when around my __[Ceci](https://github.com/autofister)__. So hey... take the chance, I'll be extra silly and have quite a mood change whenever she's around! Pretty sure you can tell just by my pronouns.cc alone.*

📌 *Pleease interact with me if you're a hololive fan or just like Limbus in general! I promise I don't bite, even if I look quite intimidating. I'm really shy and introverted at first but slowly we'll work it out, just have a tiiiny bit of patience with me and you'll see how magically I can turn our conversation in a fun time! I don't really have any __dni__ list of some sorts nor am I selective of those who I choose to be friends with, all you need to know is that if you're just a jerk and an asshole to anyone or my friends in specific, __you're not welcomed__. Although, if you do have a reason to be; just tell me it's a personal beef between you both or something... I won't stick my nose in further.*

# We're almost there, It'll be quick!!
📜 *Before you interact... please keep in mind the following!!*
- Avoid asking really personal questions & related, you'll be just making me want to hide you.
- Don't roleplay with me, for the love of god. I'll feel so awkward and cringe that I'll instantly hide you, I am not the character that I'm with the cos of!!
- You're more guaranted to get a reply if you whisper me, I do not keep public chat on!!
- Very low energy & tired individual here... that is if my __[Via](https://github.com/autofister)__ is not around.
- I'm really introverted and quite blunt with stuff!
- My attention-span is genuinely really bad, so do remind me if I drift away a bit of our current topic.
- Social-battery drains super fast... so if I suddenly be really silent, I'm just recharging!!
- C + H is completely fine!! But if I'm with my __[Ceci](https://github.com/autofister)__ please ask her instead, she's my beloved and I'll naturally prioritize her comfort first. That also applies if I'm with a friend or someone else, be mindful!!
- Patience is very much a necessity when it comes to me... teehe...
- I'm a jester and I'm very much a prankster!! Please do not take what I say seriously or to your heart, I'll always use tone-tags to make it easier to tell!
- If you want to find me... it's better to just be where [@autofister](https://github.com/autofister) is, because I'm a literally koala and she's my tree/silly
- I'm really honest about stuff and I __DO NOT__ sugarcoat stuff, if you ask me for an opinion or what I think; be ready, because I __do not care__ at all if you'll get upset or if the answer won't please you. I'm a really realistic person and that will not change the slightest, I will not be mean but sincere.
- Weirdness runs in my veins and I'm a very exotic type of person, you'll see it for yourself... I PROMISE I'M STILL NICE THOUGH!!
- Deadass most awkward person you'll ever meet I swear
